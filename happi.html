				    <p>HAPPI, a team project that focused on inefficiencies in the medical space.</p>
                                    <p>HAPPI (Health App for People with Preventative Issues), a new tool for people who want to find local support group meetings for coping with their issues. Whether someone is struggling with addiction, loss, or health issues, they can use HAPPI to find people who can relate to their struggles.</p>
<p>My role was to come up with the strategy and design the app.</p>

				<li><p align="left"><strong>Process</strong></p></br><p align="left"><u>Problem</u>  -  Propose a plan that will reduce inefficiencies that exist within the medical landscape using a technology in an innovative way.</br> <u>Understand</u>  -  The team researched innovative technology and its scientific evidence for success. </br> <u>Ideate</u>  -  The team brainstormed ideas focused on preventative care and decided on a practical solution.</br> <u>Refine</u>  -  I went back to create user flow and storyboard to explain the concept.</br> <u>Prototype</u>  -  I created interaction flow, wireframes, and high-fidelity interface mock-ups to better illustrate the user experience.</p></li>				
				<li><p align="left"><strong>Problem</strong></p></br><p align="left">Michael and Susan Dell gave $50 million grant to develop Dell Medical School at University of Texas at Austin, and they aim to improve access and quality of healthcare in the Travis County area. The Roden Medical Innovation Panel has given us the prompt below.</p><p align="left"><b>"Propose a plan for the implementation of a single new technology that will reduce inefficiencies that exist within the medical landscape. Alternatively, the panel will accept a modified version of an existing technology to be implemented in an innovative way."</b></p></li>
				<li><p align="left"><strong>Understand</strong></p></br><p align="left">We started out with brainstorming ideas leaning toward more technical side since the prompt focused on being innovative. As we discuss more advanced technologies, we realized that there were little evidence to back up how reliable and secure the technology can be. So we shifted our focus to target inefficiencies with a more attainable solution.</p><p align="left">Preventative care: many diseases are self-induced, self-inflicted or preventable with certain lifestyle changes. The World Health Organization predicts that by 2020, two-thirds of disease will stem from lifestyle choices.</p></li>
				<li><p align="left"><strong>Research</strong></p><img src="images/happi-images/preventative.PNG" alt="" class="img-responsive"/><p>This graphs shows that support groups helps patients abstain from substance use.</p></br><img src="images/happi-images/preventative2.PNG" alt="" class="img-responsive"/><p align="left">45.1 percent is a substantial number in terms of how many people can be treated based on support group and no need to go into the hospital for sickness.</p></li>
				<li><p align="left"><strong>Ideate</strong></p></br><p align="left">Three of the most important things to health are rest, diet, and exercise, so we were beginning to think about ideas that can help people track those three things in order to stay on top of their health. But then we realized there are existing apps that revolve around that concept and yet people proceed to be hospitalized due to bad health care. That did not interrupt our focus on preventative care. We thought about what can we do to help the people who already have health issues and could prevent them from having them in the future. With some brainstorming and research, we found that support groups are the answer.</p></li>
				<li><p align="left"><strong>Design</strong></p></br><img src="images/happi-images/happi-mockups.png" alt="" class="img-responsive"/><p align="left"><u>Solution:</u> We aim to provide a platform for people with life issues, conditions, or addictions, to more easily access peers and groups who share similar difficulties, so that further health problems can be prevented.</br></br><u>Innovation:</u> Our app is the first generic unified support group database. We are not an online discussion and we are not creating support groups. This is a tool for people to find a suitable group.</br><p align="left"><u>Details:</u> Personal profiles to encourage one on one connections. Although people join support groups for community experience, sometimes they want a heart-to-heart with a single person. There are people who are not as comfortable in group settings. Users can personally message other members after the meeting if they want to meet up or if they have any questions. There is also a feedback check (ex. 30 mins after the meeting ended) to ask the attendees if the meeting helped them.</p><p align="left"><u>Functionality:</u> personal profiles for one-on-one connections, support group database, support group profiles, calendar of events, reminders and feedback check.</p></li>
				<li><p align="left"><strong>Result</strong></p></br><img src="images/happi-images/winner.png" alt="" class="img-responsive"/></br><p align="left">Our team placed first place out of 15 teams in the case competition. After speaking with the judges, we learn that we won by a feasible element of our solution in comparison to other teams. Like in our prediction, other teams used advanced technology that we are unsure about to solve the inefficiencies in the medical landscape. The judges loved the idea so much that they encourage us to make this a reality since the implementation is attainable.</p></li>
